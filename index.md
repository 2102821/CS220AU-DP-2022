# HOW DOES DIGITAL DIVIDE BECOME AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO SOCIETY

## Introduction
### WHAT IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT?

The website future of humanity insitutue [FAQ states that](https://existential-risk.org/faq) an uncertainty that poses a threat to humankind's entire future is known as an existential threat. Existential risks, more particularly, are those that put intelligent life that originated on Earth in danger of going extinct or drastically and permanently losing its possibility for desired future development. There has never been a catastrophic existential event. If humans go extinct before the universe reaches its "heat death" or before our capacity to produce value is fully realised, it would be an existential disaster. If the future potential of civilization is permanently and drastically destroyed, some situations in which humanity survives will also constitute existential catastrophes; this will be to human civilization what a life term in prison or a severe brain injury is to a person.

### WHAT IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE?

The [FAQ website Iberdrola says](https://www.iberdrola.com/social-commitment/what-is-digital-divide) the "digital divide," which impacts 52% of women and 42% of men globally, is a disparity in the availability of internet access and communications technology. When we consider regions, the difference is even more pronounced: as of December 2021, only 43.1% of people in Africa had an internet connection, compared to 88.4% of individuals living in Europe and 93.4% of people in the United States, regardless of the fact that 3G and 4G networks are already present almost everywhere on the planet, while waiting for the massive 5G rollout, the data reveals the technological divide that exists between some nations and others. Here, it's critical to make a distinction between Internet connectivity and technological literacy, or the process of learning that equips a person with the knowledge and abilities to comprehend and take advantage of the educational, financial, and social advantages of new technologies.

However, the digital divide was originally thought to be the result of economic stagnation and was considered to be a passing phenomenon that would vanish as technology became more widely used. Instead, despite the widespread advertising of digital equipment with Internet access, the divide still exists today. The reasons for this can be anything from the expensive nature of the aforementioned devices to ignorance of how to use them or a lack of facilities for their accessibility. Therefore, the lack of digital tech talent could be an existential risk to business growth and innovation, it has been gradually escalating for years. The speed of everything has now increased, which many people weren't aware of. We are currently living in a brand-new, rapidly evolving technological society. Just to keep up with the changes, you'll need to have some basic technical skills. If you do not, you will almost certainly fall further behind. Individuals must constantly educate themselves if they want to remain ahead of the curve. Luckily, many forward-thinking businesses provide opportunities for you to acquire new skills. This is particularly true now that smart corporate leaders understand that giving employees access to information is the key to winning the war for skills and bucking the Great Resignation trend. In order to help people, learn technology, computer security, artificial intelligence, the analysis of data, and software engineering, Udacity is an edtech company that provides extensive, open courses online. These are the skills required for the workplace of the future.

According to Kelly (2022), he stated that Udacityâ€™s CEO Gabriel Dalporto, explained how the business name was inspired by its willingness to be "provocative for oneself, the student," can assist you in advancing your professional life. The global online curriculum provider "changes lives, companies, and countries through drastic skill conversion in mobile technology" and provides courses in 190 nations. The skills shortage has attained a crisis pitch, according to Dalporto, who was speaking about the speeding up of technological advances and how they are affecting the workplace. He added, "Businesses will fail if they do not engage in talent modification." Businesses all over the world now face an existential threat due to a lack of digital talent that is ready for the workforce.

## How does the digital divide pose as an existential threat?

In our race to protect humanity from the obvious and immediate dangers posed by the environmental crisis, relevant data analysis, and documentation are crucial building blocks. If we want to save our planet and our citizens from the catastrophic consequences of sea level rise, thermal spikes, extreme weather, and other climate changes that are halting global human, social, and industrial growth, we must act decisively and comprehensively. 

The only issue is that there are digital haves and have-nots in our world. Simply put, if we want to save civilization from the truly existential threat of this enormous and complex crisis, we need to close the digital gap and create a more effective and implementable climate risk evaluation. Climate risk assessments will offer the scientific proof we need to achieve the goals for reduced emissions and climate-resilient advancement underlined in the Paris Agreement and investment plans for the next 30 years. And while we are getting better at modelling climate change, there are still significant gaps in the overlay of weakness, environmental, and weather information that make it difficult for us to properly estimate upcoming risks and create useful models at the local, regional, and global scales.

In the developing world, climate data is still manually entered. These data sets span more than 30 years. However, since there is no way to verify its accuracy, it does not provide much help as we try to clearly map and prepare for numerous climate scenarios. It is becoming increasingly challenging to simulate precipitation, the risk of flooding, and even rising seas without this collective data base and the digital firepower required to ensure we are crunching these numbers in accordance with the Four Vs of Big Data: capacity, range, acceleration, and factuality. Because we fail to collect and analyse weather and climate statistics properly, we are halting advancement and putting lives in danger.
 
### DIGITAL COLONIALISM

This could be another form of existential risk in the digital world. Traditional colonialism involved the eviction of indigenous populations from their lands, the exploitation of their labour, the exercise of extraterritorial rule, and the deliberate backwardness necessary to maintain reliance and plunder. Businesses like the East India Company were crucial to this process. Europeans seized control and possession of vital infrastructure, such as port facilities, water sources, and railroad tracks, in their quest for wealth and power. As a result, tech companies have spread their products throughout the world, collecting data and money from users everywhere while concentrating energy and resources in the US (with China as a growing competitor). Because of the abundance of widely accessible information and technology, less developed nations are unable to create industries and products that can rival those of wealthy Western nations. Additionally, they are unable to defend their people against oppression

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the digital divide in the world can cause danger to humanity if people do not learn technological skills to help the economy. This could also cause an existential threat to humanity if companies or educational institutions do not invest in teaching and providing technological devices in underdeveloped countries and schools that cannot provide laptops for their students.
