### HOW DOES DIGITAL DIVIDE BECOME AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO SOCIETY 

## Introduction
### WHAT IS AN EXISTENTAIL THREAT?
#### An uncertainty that poses a threat to humankind's entire future is known as an existential threat. Existential risks, more particularly, are those that put intelligent life that originated on Earth in danger of going extinct or drastically and permanently losing its possibility for desired future development. There has never been a catastrophic existential event. If humans go extinct before the universe reaches its "heat death" or before our capacity to produce value is fully realised, it would be an existential disaster. If the future potential of civilization is permanently and drastically destroyed, some situations in which humanity survives will also constitute existential catastrophes; this will be to human civilization what a life term in prison or a severe brain injury is to a person.
